# Image-Compression-using-SVD
This project uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for image compression in Python. It compresses grayscale images by approximating the image matrix, reducing storage size while visualizing quality at different compression levels. Includes singular value analysis and quality vs. size graphs for better understanding.
